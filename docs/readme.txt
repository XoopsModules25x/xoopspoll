Description
------------
The Polls module can be used to display interactive survey forms on your site. Each poll can display a question on which visitors can ‘vote’. This can be a valuable way to collect feedback from your community. Polls can be configured to allow single or multiple choices and visitors can view the ‘results’ to date.

Install/uninstall
