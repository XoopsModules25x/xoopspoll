Description
------------
The Polls module can be used to display interactive survey forms on your site. Each poll can display a question on which visitors can ‘vote’. This can be a valuable way to collect feedback from your community. Polls can be configured to allow single or multiple choices and visitors can view the ‘results’ to date.

Requirements
------------------

- PHP version:   5.3.0
- XOOPS version: 2.5.5
- MySQL version: 5.0.7 (5.0.9+ recommended)
- ModuleClasses: 1.1 in /Frameworks (download it from here: http://goo.gl/Bmknt if using XOOPS < 2.5.5)

Install/uninstall
------------------
No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process – extract the /xoopspoll folder into the ../modules directory. Install the module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules.

Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the XOOPS Operations Manual (http://goo.gl/adT2i)
